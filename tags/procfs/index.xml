    <description><![CDATA[procfs and sysfs are both pseudo filesystems located in the root directory of the Unix FS heirarchy. They contain files which act as a window to the kernel and allows user-land processes to see and change important system information. Upon inspection (if you wrote the command $ ls -al /proc on a Unix system) you would notice that all files are 0 in size. This is due to the window aspect, one a user-land process reads/opens one of these files, it is at that moment the kernel writes that information to the file, hence the analogy.]]></description>
